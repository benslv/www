Hi, I'm Ben! I'm a software engineer at [Starling Bank](https://starlingbank.com), currently living in London. If I'm not at my computer, you can probably find me at the gym, [reading](https://hardcover.app/@bens), or playing saxophone 🎷

## Projects

Here are some of the things I've made:

🎧 [**insync**](https://insync.rocks) is a smart playlist generator for Spotify

🥬 [**lettucewatch**](https://lettuce.watch) is a real-time, collaborative movie picker for friends

📰 [**instapaper-ts**](https://github.com/benslv/instapaper-ts) is a TypeScript client for the [Instapaper](https://instapaper.com) API

**📚** [**marks**](https://marks.bensilverman.co.uk) is a custom frontend for Instapaper, *powered by marks!*

You can see more of my projects on [my GitHub](https://github.com/benslv) :)
